A collection of modular synthesiser projects

Full disclosure, I'm not an electronics engineer, I'm a guitarist.

I've played the Electric Guitar for nearly 40 years and I've replaced and upgraded the electronics in nearly every Guitar I've ever owned. This started my journey to understanding electronic circuits, which inevitably led to designing and building Guitar Effect pedals.
Whilst researching audio electronics, I stumbled upon modular synthesis and was inspired to build my own synthesiser. I'm still at the beginning of my Modular Synth journey and hope this repo will be a record of my continuing journey. I know that github is full of amateur modular synth builders, many of them more knowledgeable than I, but I hope these projects will still be useful to others.
