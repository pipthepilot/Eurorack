# VCO

I chose to build a proven design for my first module, and the Befaco Even-VCO was a great option for circuit analysis.

It has an analogue oscillator based on the LM393 OpAmp and utilises a reference voltage with a chain of resistors to divide the voltage across multiple octaves. 

It also has multiple wave converter circuits, converting a SAW wave to SIN, TRI and pulse width modulated SQR wave. Additionally, it creates a modulated wave combining the SIN with SAW.
